# alarm-clock

## Project Brief: ##

#### Requirements: ####
- display the current time in a digital clock format
- display in this format: hours:minutes:seconds - counting up to something within the same day and day-month-year if applicable counting up something on a different day
- pick a time to make the alarm go off (this can be done as a variable)
- make sure the clock updates every second without refreshing the page
- start the alarm when the difference between the current time and the time the alarm is set for reaches 0 (tip: use a javascript alert, you do not need it to make noise)


#### Stretch Goals: ####
- add the date - day month and year
- add a button for toggling between a 12 hour and a 24 hour display
- have a button to snooze the alarm for 5 minutes
- have a toggle to turn on or off the alarm (i only wake up at 6 on the weekdays but turn off on the weekend)
- allow the user to pick a time for the alarm to go off using an html datetime input element
- change the font for the display, a mono-spaced font would look more like a digital clock
- play an audible alert when the alarm goes off
- make it look like an analog clock
